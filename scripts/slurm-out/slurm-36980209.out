Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.188581 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.185728 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.162127 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.0552836 (Pval = 0.591962)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.21364 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.214845 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.178278 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.177135 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.179223 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.175101 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.177835 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.0920607 (Pval = 0.393285)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.175668 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.047183 (Pval = 0.637139)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.183792 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.166877 (Pval = 0.113362)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.161794 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
