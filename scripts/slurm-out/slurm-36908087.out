Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.156042 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
