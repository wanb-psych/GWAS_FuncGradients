 7.19472e-09 -7.18818e-09
-7.18818e-09  7.22201e-09

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	6.58792e-05	8.48217e-05
Ve	0.000721418	8.49824e-05
Vp	0.000787297

Heritability = 0.0836776 (Pval = 0.437348)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.271461 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

 8.53799e-09 -8.53058e-09
-8.53058e-09  8.57652e-09

Source	Variance	SE

Ve	0.00083626	9.26095e-05

Heritability = 0.0761744 (Pval = 0.455518)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.261178 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
