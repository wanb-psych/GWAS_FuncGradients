Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

 1.24613e-08 -1.24424e-08
-1.24424e-08  1.24964e-08

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	0.000141342	0.00011163
Ve	0.000916482	0.000111787
Vp	0.00105782

Heritability = 0.133616 (Pval = 0.205454)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.25653 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Note: the sample IDs (FID IID) in the model file must also present in the genotype file for further association step.
