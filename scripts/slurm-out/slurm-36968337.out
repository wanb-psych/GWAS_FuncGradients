Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.162489 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.1715 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.184121 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.0984636 (Pval = 0.339343)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.187027 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.178927 (Pval = 0.0661524)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.175324 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.176478 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.156671 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.168872 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.174007 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.171584 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.165581 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.24886 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.0723805 (Pval = 0.488373)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.167922 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.172149 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.12472 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.138994 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.135854 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.149156 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Heritability = 0.00516547 (Pval = 0.959071)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.140521 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
