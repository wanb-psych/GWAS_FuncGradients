Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA-REML converged.

Sampling variance/covariance of the estimates of Vg and Ve:
 4.59874e-08 -4.59626e-08
-4.59626e-08  4.61996e-08

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	7.97687e-05	0.000214447
Ve	0.00167967	0.000214941
Vp	0.00175943

Heritability = 0.0453377 (Pval = 0.709912)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.155888 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
