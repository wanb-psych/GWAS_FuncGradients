 3.02917e-09 -3.02751e-09
-3.02751e-09  3.04355e-09

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	3.21472e-20	5.50379e-05
Ve	0.000521373	5.51684e-05
Vp	0.000521373

Heritability = 6.16588e-17 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.180309 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant (i.e., p > 0.05). This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
