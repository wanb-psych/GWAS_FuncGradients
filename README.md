### $ python

- `py00`: generating individual gradients using different sparsity scores, which are aligned to HCP group-level gradients.

- `py01`: generating null group-level gradients by variogram, based on the HCP group-level geometric distance.

- `py02`: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Pearson r, between individual gradients and HCP group-level.

- `py03`: integrating these scores from py03 into one file.

- `py04`: preparing phenotype files (global-level) for the heritability analysis and GWAS.

- `py05`: combining autochromosome and sexual chromosome results (because GWAS performed them separately) and filtering the MAF<0.1%.

- `py06`: preparing phenotype files (region-level) for the heritability analysis and GWAS.

- `py07`: imputing the missing gene expression, Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), for Glasser parcellation, based on variogram of center coordinates of each parcel in volumetric space.

- `visualization`: generating all figures and other statistics in the paper.

- `twin genetics`: using the previous code from my repos (https://github.com/CNG-LAB/cngopen/tree/main/asymmetry_functional_gradients, https://github.com/wanb-psych/microstructural_asymmetry/blob/main/run_solar.sh)

### $ bash

- `run00-03,05`: working with python scripts and slurm using the high-performance computing service.

- `run04`: GWAS code for gradients using GCTA64.

- `run06`: extracting heritability scores from GCTA64 output.

### $ r

- `manhtn`: Manhattan plots for GWAS summaries using R package "CMplot".
